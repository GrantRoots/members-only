# members-only

This is a project I made where people can make an account and post messages to the database. All users can see the messages but only users who enter a special password to become a member can see the date the message was written and the name of the author. Users can also become admins by entering another secret password to be able to delete messages. I made this with bcryptjs, passport, pgsql, express, and ejs.
